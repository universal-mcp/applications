| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_batch_compliance_jobs` | Retrieves a list of compliance jobs, requiring a job `type` ('tweets' or 'users') and allowing optional filtering by `status`. This function fetches multiple jobs, distinguishing it from `get_batch_compliance_job` which retrieves a single job by its unique ID. |
| `create_batch_compliance_job` | Creates a new batch compliance job for a specified type ('tweets' or 'users'). A custom name can be provided, and resumable uploads can be enabled. This initiates the job creation process, differing from functions that list or retrieve existing jobs. |
| `get_compliance_job` | Retrieves a single batch compliance job by its unique ID. Unlike `list_batch_compliance_jobs`, which fetches a list, this function returns details for one specific job. Optional parameters can customize which data fields are returned in the response. |
| `create_dm_conversation` | Creates a new group Direct Message conversation with specified participants and sends an initial message. This function specifically handles the creation of new multi-participant conversations, distinct from other methods in this class that add messages to existing one-to-one or group DMs. |
| `get_dm_events_by_participant_id` | Retrieves direct message events from a conversation identified by a specific participant's ID. Supports pagination and filtering by event type. This method is distinct from `get_dm_conversations_id_dm_events`, which uses a direct conversation ID for retrieval instead of a participant's ID. |
| `send_dm_by_participant_id` | Sends a direct message to a user specified by their participant ID. It creates a new one-on-one conversation or appends the message to an existing one. Unlike other functions, this method identifies the conversation using the participant's ID rather than a pre-existing conversation ID. |
| `add_message_to_dm_conversation` | Sends a new message with optional text and attachments to an existing Direct Message conversation. The target conversation is specified by its `dm_conversation_id`, distinguishing it from functions that create new conversations or send one-to-one messages using a participant ID. |
| `get_dm_events_by_conversation_id` | Retrieves direct message events for a specific conversation using its unique ID. This function, distinct from fetching by participant ID, supports pagination, event type filtering, and data field expansion for detailed results. |
| `get_dm_events` | Retrieves a list of direct message events, unlike `get_dm_events_by_id` which fetches a single event. Supports pagination, filtering by event type, and specifying which data fields to return for various objects to customize the API response. |
| `delete_dm_event` | Deletes a specific Direct Message (DM) event identified by its unique ID. This function issues an authenticated HTTP DELETE request to the API to permanently remove the specified event, returning a confirmation of the deletion. |
| `get_dm_event_by_id` | Fetches a specific Direct Message event using its unique ID. Optional parameters allow customizing the response by selecting specific fields for the event, media, users, and tweets, and by including expanded object details. This differs from `get_dm_events`, which retrieves a list of events. |
| `get_likes_compliance_stream` | Streams compliance-related data for 'like' events, such as un-likes, with optional time and backfill filters. This endpoint is for compliance monitoring, differing from the firehose and sample streams which provide real-time like creation events. |
| `get_likes_firehose_stream` | Streams a comprehensive, real-time 'firehose' of all like events from a specified data partition. This function allows time-based filtering and customization of returned fields, providing a complete data flow distinct from the compliance or sampled stream methods. |
| `likes_sample10_stream` | Streams a 10% sample of real-time like events, a low-volume alternative to the full firehose stream. It allows filtering by partition and time range, and supports data enrichment by specifying tweet, user, and expansion fields to customize the response. |
| `create_list` | Creates a new list on X (formerly Twitter) with an optional name, description, and privacy setting. It sends a POST request to the `/2/lists` endpoint and returns the JSON data of the newly created list upon success. |
| `delete_list` | Permanently deletes a specific Twitter List identified by its unique ID. This function sends an authorized DELETE request to the API's `/2/lists/{id}` endpoint, returning a confirmation response upon successful removal. It is distinct from `list_remove_member`, which only removes a user from a list. |
| `get_list_by_id` | Retrieves detailed information for a specific list by its ID. This function allows for response customization by specifying which list and user fields to return and supports expansions to include related objects like the owner's user data. |
| `update_list` | Modifies an existing Twitter list identified by its unique ID. This function updates the list's name, description, or privacy status by sending a PUT request to the API and returns the updated list data upon success. |
| `get_list_followers` | Retrieves the users who follow a specific list, identified by its ID. Supports pagination and allows for the customization of returned user, tweet, and expansion fields to tailor the response data, differentiating it from fetching list members. |
| `list_get_members` | Retrieves users who are members of a specific Twitter list, identified by its ID. Unlike `list_get_followers`, this returns users explicitly added to the list, not subscribers. Supports pagination and customization of the returned user data fields to include expanded objects and specific details. |
| `list_add_member` | Adds a user to a specified Twitter list via a POST request to the `/2/lists/{id}/members` endpoint, requiring list and user IDs. This function modifies a list's membership, distinguishing it from `list_get_members` (retrieves) and its counterpart `list_remove_member` (deletes). |
| `delete_list_member` | Removes a specific user from a Twitter list. This function sends a DELETE request to the `/2/lists/{id}/members/{user_id}` API endpoint, requiring both the list ID and the user ID to perform the action and confirm the member's removal. |
| `get_list_tweets` | Retrieves tweets from a specified Twitter List using its ID. Supports pagination and allows extensive customization of returned fields for tweets, users, media, and other entities. This function uniquely fetches the list's tweet timeline, distinguishing it from functions that retrieve list members or followers. |
| `get_open_api_spec` | Args: |
| `find_spaces_by_ids` | Retrieves detailed information for a batch of spaces, specified by a list of their unique IDs.
