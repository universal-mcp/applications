# FalaiApp MCP Server

An MCP Server for the FalaiApp API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool List

This is automatically generated from OpenAPI schema for the FalaiApp API.


| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run` | Executes a Fal AI application synchronously, waiting for completion and returning the result directly. This method is suited for short-running tasks, unlike `submit` which queues a job for asynchronous processing and returns a request ID instead of the final output. |
| `submit` | Submits a job to the Fal AI queue for asynchronous processing, immediately returning a request ID. This contrasts with the `run` method, which waits for completion. The returned ID is used by `check_status`, `get_result`, and `cancel` to manage the job's lifecycle. |
| `check_status` | Checks the execution state (e.g., Queued, InProgress) of an asynchronous Fal AI job using its request ID. It provides a non-blocking way to monitor jobs initiated via `submit` without fetching the final `result`, and can optionally include logs. |
| `get_result` | Retrieves the final result of an asynchronous job, identified by its `request_id`. This function waits for the job, initiated via `submit`, to complete. Unlike the non-blocking `check_status`, this method blocks execution to fetch and return the job's actual output upon completion. |
| `cancel` | Asynchronously cancels a running or queued Fal AI job using its `request_id`. This function complements the `submit` method, providing a way to terminate asynchronous tasks before completion. It raises a `ToolError` if the cancellation request fails. |
| `upload_file` | Asynchronously uploads a local file to the Fal Content Delivery Network (CDN), returning a public URL. This URL makes the file accessible for use as input in other Fal AI job execution methods like `run` or `submit`. A `ToolError` is raised if the upload fails. |
| `run_image_generation` | A specialized wrapper for the `run` method that synchronously generates images using the 'fal-ai/flux/dev' model. It simplifies image creation with common parameters like `prompt` and `seed`, waits for the task to complete, and directly returns the result containing image URLs and metadata. |
