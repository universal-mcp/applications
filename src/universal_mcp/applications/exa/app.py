        Executes a query against the Exa API's `/search` endpoint, returning a list of results. This function supports extensive filtering by search type, category, domains, publication dates, and specific text content to refine the search query and tailor the API's response.
        
        Args:
            query (string): The query string for the search. Example: 'Latest developments in LLM capabilities'.
            useAutoprompt (boolean): Autoprompt converts your query to an Exa-style query. Enabled by default for auto search, optional for neural search, and not available for keyword search. Example: 'True'.
            type (string): The type of search. Neural uses an embeddings-based model, keyword is google-like SERP. Default is auto, which automatically decides between keyword and neural. Example: 'auto'.
            category (string): A data category to focus on. Example: 'research paper'.
            numResults (integer): Number of results to return (up to thousands of results available for custom plans) Example: '10'.
            includeDomains (array): List of domains to include in the search. If specified, results will only come from these domains. Example: "['arxiv.org', 'paperswithcode.com']".
            excludeDomains (array): List of domains to exclude from search results. If specified, no results will be returned from these domains.
            startCrawlDate (string): Crawl date refers to the date that Exa discovered a link. Results will include links that were crawled after this date. Must be specified in ISO 8601 format. Example: '2023-01-01'.
            endCrawlDate (string): Crawl date refers to the date that Exa discovered a link. Results will include links that were crawled before this date. Must be specified in ISO 8601 format. Example: '2023-12-31'.
            startPublishedDate (string): Only links with a published date after this will be returned. Must be specified in ISO 8601 format. Example: '2023-01-01'.
            endPublishedDate (string): Only links with a published date before this will be returned. Must be specified in ISO 8601 format. Example: '2023-12-31'.
            includeText (array): List of strings that must be present in webpage text of results. Currently, only 1 string is supported, of up to 5 words. Example: "['large language model']".
            excludeText (array): List of strings that must not be present in webpage text of results. Currently, only 1 string is supported, of up to 5 words. Example: "['course']".
